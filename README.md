# Comments

This is a Firefox extension.
Download it by clicking on the green **Code** button above then selecting **Download ZIP**
Install it by opening the url **about:debugging** in Firefox, selecting **This Firefox**, then select **Load Temporary Add-on...**

You can then select any of the files in the downloaded zip to load the add-on. It will be removed after Firefox is restarted.

Continue clicking on orange highlighted 'show replies' links and the 'view more comments' button until the comment counter above the article stops increasing.

When you get near to the end, make sure to click 'view more comments' a couple more times while keeping an eye on the label that shows the number of comments stored. This is because comments without replies are stored automatically and it may appear 'view more comments' is not showing any more comments because they are being automatically removed. Once the comment counter stops increasing when you click 'view more comments' you are finished.

You can then download the results using the button in the address bar. The icon is a one dollar note.
